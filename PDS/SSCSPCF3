)AREA SAREA01
$ + Specifies the selection criterion based on the
$ + UCB Address. Volumes can be included or excluded
$ + based on UCB Address.
$ + Multiple UCB Addresses, separated by a space
$ + or a comma, can be entered. A volume matching any
$ + of the UCB Addresses will be eligible for selection.
$ +
$ + Wildcard characters can be used:
$ +  '*' - all remaining characters
$ +  '?' - any single character
$ +  '%' - any single character
$ +
$ + Default: Null
$ +          UCB Address is not considered during
$ +          selection.
$ +
$ + If a UCB Address of less that 4 characters is
$ + entered, it is right-filled with '*'. Further,
$ + if no volumes are found when selecting by UCB
$ + Address, and the right-most character of the UCB
$ + Address is '*', the UCB Address will be shifted
$ + right by 1 character, a '0' inserted as the left-
$ + most character, and the search repeated. For
$ + example, if a UCB address of 1D2 were entered,
$ + a search for UCBs 1D2* would be made. If no UCBs
$ + were found, a second search for UCB 01D2 would be
$ + made.
$ +
$ + Note that a DASD volume must satisfy@all+criteria
$ + (Volser, UCB, SMS Storage Group, Estoric Name,
$ + and/or Mount Attribute) specified to be selected.
