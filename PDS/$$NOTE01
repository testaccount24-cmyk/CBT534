Hello!

I've attached an update of the assembler source  space", which is
included in:

File # 534 SPACE command from Paul Dion

We are using this tool very often, it's very useful and fast, but
it had some lack of use for extended address volumes.

The volsize shown was incorrect (to small, max. 51.1G). Now,
using the right field for EAVs, the volsize is correct.

There are only 3 or 4 new lines and some additional change
comment lines. So, I didn't want to repack the complete file 534.

You may find the updates searching  MAHLER".

Best regards,
