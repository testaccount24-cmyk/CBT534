   This is (yet) another version of the ubiquitous SPACE command
that displays DASD volume usage statistics. It can:
   - cope with DASD devices RESERVEd on other systems without
     hanging
   - run as a TSO command or batch program
   - use EDIF or BRIF to display results
   - resolve system symbolics (including substringing)
   - create machine-readable output (UCB, DCE, LSPACE data, F4DSCB)
   - select devices based on UCB address, Volser, Esoteric, Mount
     Attribute, and/or SMS Storage Group
   - sort results by any of the displayed fields

   The data presented by the command are:
   - UCB address
   - Volser
   - Device Type
   - Use Attribute
   - Free Trks, Cyls, %
   - Largest Trks, Cyls
   - Fragmentation Index
   - VTOC Trks, free DSCBs, % free
   - VTOC Index status
   - Indexed VTOC Status
   - Volume Capacity
   - SMS Storage Group
   - SMS Volume Status
   - CHPIDs


   This version of the SPACE command seems to be able to cope with
DASD RESERVEd on another system. This is a non-issue for those instal-
lations that have IBM APAR OW48527 installed, which allows the invoker
of LSPACE to specify a time-out value (in seconds). For those
installations that do not have the APAR installed, the matter becomes
somewhat complicated.

   If LSPACE (SVC 78) is issued against a UCB that is RESERVEd on
another system, it will wait until the RESERVE is released. For
long-term RESERVEs, this becomes quite annoying. LSPACE gets 'hung'
because:
   - LSPACE creates an ESTAE with PURGE=NONE
   - LSPACE degenerates into CVAF
   - CVAF creates an ESTAE with PURGE=QUIESCE
   - CVAF tries to touch the device, and waits
   - If the Address Space is cancelled, an attempt to QUIESCE the I/O
     is made, so that the 1st ESTAE (CVAFs) can be invoked. The I/O
     cannot be QUIESCEd while the RESERVE is outstanding, so everything
     comes to a halt.

   This program tries to cope with this by establishing an ESTAE that
will ignore volumes that are being processed when an error occurs. It
then issues a STIMERM SET with an exit, issues LSPACE, and issues a
STIMERM CANCEL after the LSPACE has completed. If the STIMERM pops
(because LSPACE is not completing), the STIMERM exit creates an ESTAE
with PURGE=HALT. This ESTAE is now 1st on the ESTAE chain, and will be
invoked before the ESTAEs of CVAF and LSPACE. The STIMERM exit next
ABENDs with a U522, kicking off the ESTAEs. The I/O is HALTed, and the
ESTAE set up by the STIMERM exit is given control. This ESTAE merely
percolates to the next ESTAE in line (CVAFs), which can now run
because the I/O has been HALTed. All the other ESTAEs do whatever it is
that they do, and we eventually end up back at our ESTAE that goes on
to process the next volume.

   While LSPACE is trying to touch a RESERVEd device, but before the
STIMERM exit kicks in, it is almost certain that SRM/WLM will come
around and decide that the Address Space should be swapped out. Before
swapping us out, the various TCBs within the A/S are made non-dispatch-
able, and an attempt made to QUIESCE the I/O. Again, the I/O cannot be
QUIESCEd until the RESERVE goes away. Meanwhile, the STIMERM pops, but
the exit (which would get us out of this mess) cannot be dispatched,
since all our TCBs are non-dispatchable.

   We address this situation by making outselves non-swappable while we
are issuing LSPACEs. This, of course, means that we have to be APF-
authorized to issue SYSEVENT DONTSWAP and OKSWAP (Note that this is the
only reason that we have to be APFed - all the code runs in Problem
State and Key 8).

   If we are running as a TSO command, because we are APFed, we cannot
use ISPF Dialog Manager facilities. If you want to allow the use of
ISPF facilities (tables, panels, EDIF, BRIF), the following strategy can
be used to install the command:
   - Link-edit as APF-authorized, in a TSO STEPLIBed or LNKLSTed library
   - Name the program in the AUTHTSF section *only* in the IKJTSOxx
     member of SYS1.PARMLIB
If this is done, the command can make use of ISPF DM services, because:
   - The command is invoked without APF
   - IKJEFTSR is used to re-invoke itself, but APFed this time, to
     retrieve the DASD information
   - The non-APFed instance can then use ISPF DM services.
