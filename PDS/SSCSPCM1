% SPACE01I  No Devices/Volumes match selection criteria
+           This message is issued when no online DASD devices were
+           found that satisfied the specified selection criteria.
+
% SPACE02I  Insufficient APF authorization
+           The SPACE command requires APF authorization, but is cur-
+           rently not authorized.
+
% SPACE03I  ISPF DM Services unavailable xx-yy
+           This message is issued when the SPACE command could not
+           use ISPF Dialogue Management Services to display the
+           results of the command in ISPF format. Either the required
+           ISPF modules were unavailable, or the environment is such
+           that ISPF Dialogue Management Services are not functional.
+           In the message, xx indicates which ISPF service is
+           unavailable, and yy is the return code from that service.
+
% SPACE04I  Forcing non-ISPF output
+           This message is issued when the user has requested that
+           the command output be displayed using ISPF Dialogue
+           Management Services, but these services are unavailable.
+           The command output is displayed using TSO line-by-line
+           facilities (PUTLINE).
+
% SPACE05I  CSVQUERY unavailable on this system xxxxx
+           The CSVQUERY function was attempted to verify that APAR
+           OW48527 had been APPLYed to this system, but CSVQUERY is
+           not available. 'xxxxx' is the Operating System level on
+           which this program is executing.
+
% SPACE06I  Program not found in STEPLIB/LNKLST
+           This command requires that the processing program reside
+           in the current STEPLIB or system LNKLST concatenation,
+           but the program cannot be located.
+
% SPACE07I  IKJEFTSR error xx-yy
+           The TSO/E Service Routine IKJEFTSR could not complete
+           successfully. xx is the Return Code, and yy the reason
+           code.
+
% SPACE08I  LSPACE failed for at least 1 volume
+           The data presented in the table is incomplete because
+           information for at least 1 DASD volume was unavailable.
+
% SPACE09I  Incompatible versions of SPACE found
+           The TSO/E Service Routine IKJEFTSR invoked a different
+           version of SPACE (from LNKLST/STEPLIB) than was
+           originally invoked (from ISPLLIB?).
+
% SPACE10I  Insufficient storage: nnn volumes omitted
+           Not enough (above-the-line) storage was available to
+           save the information for all selected DASD volumes. nnn
+           indicates how many volumes were not processed.
+
% SPACE11I  Internal error - unknown invocation type
+           The program could not determine how it was invoked. This
+           is most likely to occur when it is being reinvoked via
+           IKJEFTSR, but the parameters passed are unrecognized.
+
% SPACE12I  OUTFILE DDname xxxxxxxx not useable - ignored.
+           This message is issued when the user has requested that
+           the volume usage data be written to a file, by specifying
+           OUTFILE(xxxxxxxx) on the command line. DDName xxxxxxxx
+           could not be OPENed for output.
