Important Note:  The SPACE command assembles cleanly on MACLIBs up
     to and including OS/390 Release 2.9.  At the Release 2.10
     level, because of a change in macro IOSDPATH in SYS1.MACLIB ,
     there are a couple of assembly errors, which are addressed by
     APAR OW46838, as follows:

  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
   We now have a new version of the SPACE command.... (SG 09/22/04)
     This is Version 2.21, which should work through z/OS 1.5.

Hi Sam,
  Man, I wish people would keep their software up-to-date!
   The IBM APAR OW46838 addresses the IOSDPATH issue:

  ERROR DESCRIPTION:
  The following messages were issued when assembling
  macro IOSDPATH:
   ASMA144E Begin-to-continue columns not blank - MACRO - IOSDPATH
   ASMA435I Record 130 in SYS1.MACLIB(IOSDPATH) on volume: OS39AR
   ASMA057E Undefined operation code - IOSDP/Vary
   ASMA435I Record 186 in SYS1.MACLIB(IOSDPATH) on volume: OS39AR


  LOCAL FIX:
  Edit the following lines in IOSDPATH (located in SYS1.MACLIB):
   $P5=PXD1562 ,HBB7703,000330,PDPS:  Update Copyright Information
  The above line continues in to column 72, erase the 'n' in
  'Information'
  indicates that path is offline due to a        07375000
  The above line needs a continuation character in column 72.

  As far as I can tell, there is no PTF.
     Paul
