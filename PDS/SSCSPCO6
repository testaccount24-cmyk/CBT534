{   - Data based on track size use available track capacity, as opposed to
{      raw track capacity. This means that, for instance, the volume size of
{      a 3390-3 is now calculated to be the generally accepted value of 2.83G,
{      instead of the previous 2.9G.
{   - Numeric values that must be scaled to fit in the display fields are
{      rounded (.5 and above are rounded up) instead of truncated.
{   - When viewing the results in ISPF(S) (the customized panels, as opposed to
{      Edit or View), the unscaled, unrounded values of numeric fields can be
{      displayed by positioning the cursor on the field, and hitting Enter. The
{      value of the field will be displayed in the upper right-hand corner of
{      the screen.
{   - Multiple instances of the program can be active concurrently in ISPF
{      split-screen mode.
{   - The LINESIZE keyword has been added to allow the user to specify the
{      length of non-ISPF output - the default is still the terminal width or
{      SYSPRINT record length.
{   - The title of the output contains the name and version of the program.
{   - z/OS.e identified in Statistics lines.
{   - Changed 'Line x of y' to 'Line x' in ISPF(S) display.
{   - WAIT for all detail lines to be populated before sorting.
{   - MAXLWAIT parameter added, to specify the maximum time to wait for
{     LSPACE to complete.
{   - Added Assembly parms to allow the installation to define:
{     - default MAXLWAIT in Foreground and Background
{     - default and maximum subtask counts
{   - Listed installation defaults in the stats lines
{   - '*E*' added to emulated devices
{   - Various internal changes
{
]   2.23
{   - Internal changes (use CRCSI to retrieve CPU-related info).
{
]   2.22
{   - Bug fix related to SMS info (again)
{
]   2.21
{   - Bug fix when selecting by UCB, and no UCBs found.
{   - When in ISPF(S) or ISPF(B) modes, you can switch to an alternate ISPF
{      output mode with the primary command ISPF(x), where
{       x = B: Browse mode
{           E: Edit Mode
{           S: Customised panel
{      Note that this primary command is *not* available in ISPF(E).
{   - Volume size field added after VTOC info.
{   - Static System symbols and substringing can be used when invoking the
{     program.
{   - Bug fix related to SMS info.
{   - Bug fix related to SA03 Abends.
{   - If input is read from SYSIN, output is sent to SYSPRINT, even if ISPF
{      is available.
{   - Honoured SYSPRINT DCB characteristics.
